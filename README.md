# Mongo Query Samples

Mongo query experiments with advanced scripting using the Mongo shell.

These queries assume you're setting the database via command line parameters.  See `mongo --help` for details.

Example: `mongo host.somewhere.com:12345/node_default -u myuser -p mypassword "Complex Conditional Query.js"`

This sample also attempts to explore modularization of scripts. See `dvir.js` for an example.  Implementation is in `sys.js`.
